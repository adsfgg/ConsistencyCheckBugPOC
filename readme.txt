POC of a consistency check bug within vanilla NS2.

Allows attacker to load custom .entry file within another mod. Using the custom .entry file the attacker can load arbitrary code changes to the game.

This exploit in theory should not be restricted by mod.
Target mod used: UWEExtension.

Example code demonstrates how an attacker can install a wallhack into vanilla NS2 without being detected by consistency checking.
